        Welcome to my portfolio, I hope what you are looking for is on this
        website. I currently have knowledge within the fields of HTML and CSS
        but am passionate in learning more languages soon. I am looking forward
        to what the coding life brings to me and hope I can get a real-time job
        in the near future.
